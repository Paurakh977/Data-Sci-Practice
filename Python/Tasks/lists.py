# Points: points = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]

# Store results as a list of tuples: (index1, index2, distance).
# Expected output: [(0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 8), (1, 2, 4)]
# Hint: Manhattan distance between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

# Extract Features from a List of Dictionaries
# Scenario: Youâ€™re given a list of dictionaries representing data points, and you need to extract a specific feature.

# Input:
# data = [

#     {'age': 30, 'income': 70000, 'years_edu': 16},

# Use a list comprehension to extract the 'income' values.
# Compute the average income.
# Expected output: [50000, 70000, 45000], average = 55000

# Implement a Simple k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier
# Scenario: You have a dataset of points with labels and need to classify a new point based on its nearest neighbor.

# Task:

# Dataset: dataset = [([1, 2], 'A'), ([3, 4], 'B'), ([5, 6], 'A')]
# New point: [2, 3]
# Calculate the Euclidean distance from the new point to each dataset point.
# Return a list of label and the value of distance of the nearest point.
# Expected output: [1.414, 'A'] (since [1, 2] is closest)
# Hint: Euclidean distance = sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2). Use math.sqrt() or compare squared distances.
